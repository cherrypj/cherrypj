My name is Mike, and my pronouns are he/him. I live in Virginia with my wife and my two sons. 

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hard-of-hearing web developer, and I wish I had a more interesting skill set. I work primarily on www.epa.gov ([Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/9)), but I also have a number of smaller clients (primarily using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), but also ExpressionEngine (RIP)) through freelance work with [Human Service Solutions](https://www.hswsolutions.com).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and JavaScript, but feel like I should pick one and get really good at it. I believe static sites will be the future, so the backend won't 100% matter, as long as the output is static.
