### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hard-of-hearing web developer, and I wish I had a more interesting skill set. I work primarily on www.epa.gov (using Drupal 7; updating to [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8)), but I also have a number of smaller clients (primarily [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), but also ExpressionEngine (RIP)).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and JavaScript, but feel like I should pick one and stick with it.
